- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yao-yt
- 👀 I’m interested in ML and bioinformatics, especially in microbiome
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML and data analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML and some interesting microbiome projects.
- 📫 You can reach me by my email: yuteng@henu.edu.cn
- 😄 Pronouns: him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I post a message "When the codes ran more than 30 minutes, I bragged online that I was no longer the Hello world teenager I was" when I took up data analysis. However, it is the large data that made that, not how complex my codes are.
