- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yao-yt
- 👀 I’m interested in ML and bioinformatics, especially in microbiome
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML and data analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML and some interesting microbiome projects.
- 📫 You can reach me by my email: yuteng@henu.edu.cn
- 😄 Pronouns: him
- ⚡ Fun fact: One day, I post a message "When I executed the code for thirty minutes. I know that I am not the 'Hello world'teenager." when I took up data analysis. However, it is the large data that made that, not how complex my codes are.
